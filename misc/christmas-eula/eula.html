              Giver hereby expresses a good-faith intent to procure from Kai's
              list the highest-quality Gifts available. This EULA recommends
              favoring items whose price is quantiatively higher than others, as
              we all know money <i>can</i> buy happiness. The Giver will
              endeavor to maximize cheer throughout the gift-giving process.

                Major Disappointment. By entering into this agreement, the Giver
                accepts the following consequences of such an event: sighs,
                eyebrow arching, staged fainting, and the long-term
                re-interpretation of family lore to emphasize the tragedy.
                Remediation may involve, at the Giver's discretion: a sincere
                handwritten apology, a dessert concession, a midnight vigil, or
                $5,000 USD cash.
