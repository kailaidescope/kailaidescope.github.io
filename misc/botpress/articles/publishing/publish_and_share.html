                                <li>Refresh the page and retry</li>

                            <p>If you are having trouble accessing the shareable webchat, it could be an issue with the link or the publishing process. Try these steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Try waiting and refreshing the page you accessed via the link</li>

                                <li>Try republishing your bot and resharing a link. It may take a minute to be accessible by the shared link, even after clicking publish. Then test the bot's website</li>
