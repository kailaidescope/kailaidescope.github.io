                        <p>If you have created a bot and want to access its editor studio, first follow the steps to access the <a href="https://app.botpress.cloud/workspaces">dashboard</a>.</p>
                        <p>Then, find the bot's name on the home screen of the dashboard, hover over it, and click <b>Edit in Studio</b>.</p>

                        <p>You will be redirected to the studio, where you can modify, test, and publish your bot.</p>
                        <p>The studio takes around 10 seconds to load, as it collects all your bot's data.</p>
                        <p>Once you are in the studio, you can use it to customize the behaviour of the bot using the emulator, your workflows, and your knowledge bases.</p>

                            <p>If the bot is not there, try looking in other workspaces, which you can access by clicking the top left corner of the dashboard.</p>
                            <p>If you still can't find the bot, check the activity logs on the right sidebar to see if it was deleted.</p>

                            <p>You may have another studio session open in the same Workspace. Since only one studio session is allowed per workspace, check if you have another session open, and close it.</p>

                            <p>A studio session is another way to say an open window on the studio page.</p>
                            <p>If you don't have another studio session open in the same Workspace, try the following steps:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Close the studio, refresh your dashboard page, and reopen the studio</li>
                                <li>Restart your browser and open the studio again</li>
                                <li>Try making a new Workspace (in the top left of the dashboard), and making a new bot. If you can open this bot's studio, try waiting for 1 minute and re-opening the original bot's studio</li>
                            </ol>
