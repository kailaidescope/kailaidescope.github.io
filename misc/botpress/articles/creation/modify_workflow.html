                            <h3>Why can't my bot generate an image?</h3>
                            <p>There are several reasons why your bot might not generate an image:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you put a <b>Generate Image</b> card into an <b>AutonomousNode</b>, the bot decides when to generate an image. Try explicitly prompting your bot to generate an image, or add instructions to the bot or its <b>Generate Image</b> card to tell it when to generate images</li>
                                <li>If prompting isn't the problem, check if you have exceeded your price plan limit. If you have, consider upgrading to a higher price limit</li>
                                <li>If you haven't put a <b>Generate Image</b> card into your <b>AutonomousNode</b>, try adding one, republishing your bot, and prompting it for an image again</li>
                                <li>If it still doesn't work, try creating a <b>StandardNode</b> and putting a <b>Generate Image</b> card inside it. Make sure you fill in the required prompt and ID fields. If this doesn't work, contact Botpress' support on their Discord.</li>
